## Instruction
To install the package, please run:
```
mvn install
```
This will compile the project and run all the tests in test.java.cse291.lsmdb.
Currently we only implement a library-based database without interactive interface.
To use our database, use the NoSQLInterface to create applications and tables and use
them as a library. You could implement any interfaces on top of them, including RMI or
HTTP servers.

The testes will create a lot of files in the "base" and "TestTable" folders.
Please remember to delete them.
